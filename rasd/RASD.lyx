\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose of the project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're tasked to design Travlendar+, an application that helps its users
 schedule appointments and arrange for travel between them.
 The killer feature of Travlendar+ is it's ability to account for travel
 time between appointment locations.
 This allows to suggest the best travel means for any specific appointment,
 based on many factors such as time required, cost, weather, CO2 emissions,
 and so on.
 The app offers many features as it tries to be as convenient as possible
 for its users (hence the motto 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Life, simplified
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
in-app automatic reservations for sharing mobility services (car, bike)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
in-app ticket shop for public transportation (bus, metro, train, ...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the possibility of setting constraints such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maximum 2km of walking for any single travel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the possibility of scheduling flexible events (see

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
About this document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document shows the functional and non-functional requirements of the
 system to be developed.
 Requirements are based on the needs expressed by the stakeholders, and
 are subject to constraints imposed by the external world.
 Common scenarios are included to document the main interactions between
 the users and the system.
 This document mainly targets the software engineers and developers who
 will have to develop the service here described, but also the project owner,
 prof.
 Di Nitto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Travlendar+ will be available on all the most used platforms (web, mobile
 and desktop).
 Other apps that partially cover Travlendar+ functionality already exist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
calendar apps that provide weather information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
public transport assistants (such as Citymapper)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
public transport ticketing apps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
navigation apps (e.g.
 Google Maps)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Altough applications such as Citymapper or Google Maps already offer an
 excellent user experience, none of those apps allow to seamlessly schedule
 an appointment while keeping track of weather and travel times.
 Moreover, ticketing apps for public transportation are often poorly built,
 which increases the need for the in-app ticket purchase functionality in
 Travlendar+.
 The existing sharing mobility services don't offer the possibility to automatic
ally reserve the nearest vehicle at a certain date and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system will need to interact with external entities and events beyond
 of our control (public transportation, sharing mobility services, weather)
 which can disrupt user experience.
 The specifications of the service are based upon the assumption that most
 of the time those external entities will behave as expected but also document
 what to do when the domain assumptions (documented in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Assumptions, dependencies and constraints"

\end_inset

) won't hold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main stakeholder in this project is our professor, Elisabetta Di Nitto,
 which we'll consider a paying customer that has tasked our development
 team to design and eventually build Travlendar+.
 The specifications and requirements for the project are coming from her.

Overall description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Travlendar+ will be composed of three major components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Travlendar+ users will need to be able to use the service from their computers
 and mobile devices.We propose a web and mobile app based system.
 Users will be able to use Travlendar+ on all platforms and have their appointme
nts always available thanks to automatic synchronization.
 Basic funcionality (e.g.
 adding an event to the calendar) will be available offline, but many features
 will need internet connectivity in order for the app to be able to query
 the backend and sync data across devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web frontend will be targeted at modern browsers with support for HTML5,
 CSS3 and recent JS APIs.
 Shims will be used to ensure the best possibile compatibility with older
 browsers, altough not all features will be available to legacy clients.
 Mobile applications will need to support 95% of the user base of iOS and
 Android when the app will be released, which at the time of writing this
 document means supporting Android 4.4+ and iOS 10+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Administrative backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An administrative web application will be needed to provide customer support
 and to manage the system.
 From there it will be possible to consult usage statistics, monitor service
 status and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The backend will be accessible only to authenticated Travlendar+ staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Business logic (server side backend)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of Travlendar+ advanced functionality will depend on server side services:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
map data and travel itineraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
public transport information such as timetables, costs, realtime status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sharing mobility services informations and functionality (e.g.
 automatic reservations)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
calendar data storage and synchronization between devides
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
push notifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A considerable amount of these functionalities will need data and services
 from external entities.
 Implementation details such as the specific service to use for weather
 data are left to the design document.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It could be implemented as an ensemble of loosely coupled services, built
 using consolidated technologies.
 This design choice allows for easier scalability and flexibility, and reliabili
ty via redundancy of critical components.

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Appointments managment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users will be able to manage their appointments by adding, editing and removing
 them.
 Multiple calendars can be used (e.g.
 a user can have a Work and a Personal calendar).
 They will be able to share single events and entire calendars with other
 people (even not registered to Travlendar+) by generating a sharing link
 or sending an email.
 A warning will be shown if it is not possible to reach an appointment destinati
on in time or if the appointment makes scheduling a flexible event impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Travel planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users will be able to plan for travel between appointments.
 They can associate to an appointment a starting location and time from
 where they will reach the destination (by default the ones of the previous
 event in that day, if present).
 They will receive suggestions compatible with the travel means they can
 use, and be able to see (when applicable):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cost of the trip
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
estimated time taken

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notification will inform the users in case of bad weather, strikes, accidents
 along the way and unabailability of sharing mobility vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Automatic sharing mobility vehicle reservations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users will be able to program automatic reservation of a sharing mobility
 vehicle for their appointments, and our service will start searching for
 a vehicle to reserve near to their position a configurable amount of time
 before the start of the trip.
 If no vehicles are available the users will receive a notification and
 alternative travel suggestions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
In-app tickets shop

\begin_layout Subsection
User characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application is primarily designed to be used by registered, logged in
 users.
 Non registered users can interact with Travlendar+ on some occasions.
 Here are documented the main characteristics and interactions for registered
 and unregistered users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
First time users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users may start using Travlendar+ when:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they access the web app (directly, from a search engine or otherwise)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they download the app for the first time on a certain device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they are sent an invite to try the app from a registered user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each case the users are sent to an informational page (or application
 screen depending on the used platform) that shows the main features of
 Travlendar+ and invites them to sign up.
 Users that decide to sign up are asked an email and a password and will
 receive a confirmation email on the specified address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unregistered users with a sharing link
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unregistered users (identified by an email address and other optional informatio
ns) may be invited to an event by a registered user.
 An email is sent to them as a reminder.
 The email contains all relevant informations about the event such as name,
 date and time, location, weather forecast, and also a link to view the
 event in the web-based version of the app, which can be used to view updated
 information about the event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The email invites them to sign up to Travlendar+ with a link to the informationa
l page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Registered users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Registered users will be identified by their email and a password.
 Other informations will be asked when appropriate:

Assumptions and dependencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Travlendar+ needs to interact with many entities and cope with events beyond
 our control, which can disrupt user experience.
 Here we document constraints and assumptions
\change_deleted 1604105849 1508172499
 
\change_unchanged
 which we'll rely on in our design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data sources and external services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to provide our users convenient services such as automatic car
 sharing reservations or weather-aware travel planning we need to source
 data from external entities which cannot be expected to be perfectly reliable.
 The specifications of the service are based upon the assumption that most
 of the time those external services will behave as expected but also document
 what to do when this assumption won't hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Commercial agreements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the external services (e.g.
 public transportation tickets) don't have a public API available, and an
 agreement with the companies providing the service will be needed in order
 to gain access and use their APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Area limit and app availability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that appointments for which the user wants help scheduling his
 travels are limited to the same area (e.g.
 the metropolitan area of Milan).
 The app will be available only to users of certain supported cities, initially
 targeting the mostly populated Italian cities for the MVP.
 Many factors make this constraint necessary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
public transportation regulations, prices, ticketing systems and timetables
 (and associated data sources) vary wildly in quality, format and availability
 between cities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
time estimates on long travels — especially when involving public transportation
 — are not accurate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suppose these conditions will be respected at any given time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
users input correctly all relevant informations about their appointments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Alice is curious about PowerEnjoy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lily tells Alice about a new service called PowerEnjoy: Alice, now curious,
 tries to register to PowerEnjoy.
 She visits the homepage, browses the site a little and then proceeds to
 the registration page.
 Alice then enters all the data needed by the system to complete the process:
 name and surname, username, email address, password, ID card number and
 license number.
 To complete the sign-up she finally enters the billing information.
 Once everything is done, the system sends her a confirmation mail with
 a link used to activate her new account.
 She has now completed the registration, and she can log into the system
 and power enjoy the service.

Grandpa Peter and his expired license
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grandpa Peter has been registered to PowerEnjoy for a quite long time.
 He loves the car sharing model, now more than ever since his old Panda
 broke a long time ago and he could not pick up his nephews, David and Goliath,
 from the pool.
 There is a problem, though: Peter is getting old, and his license has to
 be renewed to drive again.
 After a long day at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Grandpa Peter
 successfully got his shiny license back! To reactivate his PowerEnjoy account,
 Peter has to edit his account data and insert the new license card number:
 after having logged in, he proceeds to his personal area by clicking “Edit
 Personal Data", he puts the new data in the system, and finally he saves
 the changes.
 Grandpa Peter is on the road, again!

Grandpa Peter and his nephews
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's rainy outside, so Grandpa Peter has to pick up his two nephews from
 the pool: he picks up his smartphone and checks if there are any available
 cars near him.
 He is getting old so he cannot walk for a long time, so he reserves the
 nearest car which, unfortunately, has less than 50% battery charge remaining.
 Once in the car's reach, Peter taps on “Open Vehicle” and inputs his verificati
on code.
 His memory is aging just like him so the usual “1969” code, which corresponds
 to the year he married his beloved Franca, turned into “1967” which is
 not accepted by the system.
 The system prompts him again, and this time Peter does not fail: the doors
 unlock, and Grandpa is on the road once more! Peter's driving skills are
 still amazing: he picks up the kids and gets home in no time, so he ends
 the rent.
 Unfortunately, he is not able to use the 20% discount due to the battery
 charge left, but he will be cut 10% since he took at least two other people
 in the car.

Tata and Pablo make a great couple.
 It's Friday night, and the theaters are flooded by the latest sci-fi movie
 everyone love.
 Pablo loves all those lightsabers and starships while Tata just can't get
 the point out of them.
 The film will start in more than one hour: Pablo is ready for the night
 out, Tata has to fix her makeup.
 “Five minutes and I am ready!" - she said.
 Unfortunately, Pablo forgot to charge his phone so he can't use his phone's
 GPS to save precious battery juice and reserves his PowerEnjoy car by entering
 his address into the app.
 Time goes by; one hour has passed, and Pablo is still waiting for Tata
 who seems to have no intentions leaving the bathroom.
 The film has just begun, the reservation expired, the car is available
 to be reserved again, and Pablo has to pay 1€ fee: “One minute and we are
 rolling!” - she said.
 Pablo, may the force be with you!

Gustavo, the discount hunter

\begin_layout Standard
Gustavo is a saver, methodic and old-fashioned man, and he built an economic
 empire from scratch.
 He owns a vintage 1968 Ford Torino which is only used on Saturday afternoons
 with his closest friend to honor the times long gone: on the other days,
 he mainly uses PowerEnjoy.
 Gustavo has turned on the money saving option while signing up, and he
 loves it.
 Once in the car, he logs in and proceed to set up his seat and insert his
 destination: the system now calculates the overall cars distribution in
 the city, verifies the availability of power plugs in the nearest power
 grid stations to the arrival and suggests to park in a special area just
 300 meters away from his destination.
 Once there, Gustavo, just before ending the rental, takes care of plugging
 the car into the power grid: now, the smartphone application shows him
 the total cost which includes the 40% discount.

This diagram is intended as a starting draft to be expanded further in the

Alloy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we tried to verify the consistency of our class diagram.
 To this goal, we realized a formal model of the system based both on the
 class diagram and in the previously done assumptions and considerations
 about constraints.
 We realized this model using Alloy syntax, thanks to which we get on formally
 describing the domain of our application and its properties.
 Then we veriﬁed the consistency of our model using Alloy Analyzer.
 Here there is the code of the model of the system.
